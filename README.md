This boilerplate is built with webpack.
Specifically, `css-loader` and `style-loader` are used to pull css and style into script.

In addition, `babel-loader` is used to transpile `.js` files. 
Transpile is needed to meet browser compatibility.
`env` preset is used in this boilerplate.

Considering convenience of development, `webpack-dev-server` is included.
It provides live reloading, which is helpful on development process.
